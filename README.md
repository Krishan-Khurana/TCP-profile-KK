This script provides filters for Wireshark. Thanks to @ramadankrera for suggesting to me that I should give the gift of this script to the world by sharing it on git.

# Instructions
- Open Wireshark 
- Goto the bottom right section of the window and right-click on "Profile" 
- In the options menu that opens, select 'Import' and select 'From Zip File'
- Navigate to this git repo's directory and select the zip file. 
- Voila! You're done! Have fun and thank me later.
